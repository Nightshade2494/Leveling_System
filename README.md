# Leveling System

A customizable leveling system built in Python, where users can gain experience points (XP), manage skills, and increase their level. This system is designed to allow users to add or delete skills, gain attribute points over time, and use those points to level up their skills. As users level up, they earn XP and gain additional attribute points at higher levels.

## System Overview

The leveling system works by allowing users to create a character with an initial level of 1. As time passes, users earn attribute points which can be applied to their skills. Each skill level up grants the user XP, and once the user reaches a certain XP threshold, they level up, earning more attribute points per hour at higher levels.

### Leveling Rules
1. **Attribute Points**: The user gains 1 attribute point per hour at level 1, which increases as they level up (e.g., 2 points/hour at level 5).
2. **Skill XP**: Each skill point increase rewards the user with 10 XP.
3. **Leveling Up**: Requires progressively more XP; for example, 100 XP for level 2, 500 XP for level 3, etc.

1. **Enter Your Name**: The program will prompt you to enter your name to create a new user profile.
2. **Show Status**: View your current level, XP, attribute points, and skills.
3. **Add/Delete Skills**: Add a new skill or delete an existing one.
4. **Level Up Skills**: Use attribute points to level up your skills, which earns you XP.
5. **Simulate Time**: (Testing option) Advance time by an hour to see attribute points accumulate.

**Example Commands**:
- Choose from menu options to perform actions.
- Follow prompts to add skill names or level up selected skills.
